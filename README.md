# pylint_junit

Pylint plugin that generates JUnit based report that can be consumed by
CI environments like Jenkins, Azure Devops and such.

# Why ?

At the time of writing, few tools existed that where able to generate
JUnit format from pylint output. Both of these projects where not
handling \"empty\" results scenario well, eg both cases generated an
empty file and that caused issues in ci as the resulting document was
not proper xml file. Another issue was that issues found by pylint where
marked under single testcase failure and this caused atleast Azure to
report a single item per file even thought there could have been
multiple.

Thus, pylint_junit was written.

# Installation

Install the package with

```bash
pip install pylint_junit
```

or add it to your requirements.

# Usage

After the plugin has been installed there are few options to take it
into use.

Add following lines into your .pylintrc:

```bash
[MASTER]
load-plugins=pylint_junit
[REPORTS]
output-format=junit
```

This does set the default output to junit, so if still want to run
pylint and get normal output, you might want to consider omitting the
\"output-format=junit\" portion and only when junit format is needed,
provide it via command line like this:

```bash
pylint --output-format=junit src/
```

Or, without making any changes to your pylint configuration, you can
just pass the class as report formatter like this:

```bash
pylint --output-format=pylint_junit.JUnitReporter src/
```
